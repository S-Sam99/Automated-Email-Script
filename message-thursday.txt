Hi Team 

Friendly reminder for those assigned to Pre-Sales opportunities:

In order to submit your timesheets on time for this week, please check that you have access to your “(PS)” opportunity buckets in OA.

If you can't find the specific Open Air pre-sales project code, just reply back here with the name of the prospect/customer and opportunity (i.e. "I'm working on that opp for Company X"). This will help us get you set up with the right codes faster to get your timesheet submitted.

Kind Regard
